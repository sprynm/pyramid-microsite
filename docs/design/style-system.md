# Style System Quick Rules

These are short, durable rules for styling and layout consistency.

## Spacing
- Spacing comes from `--space-*` tokens, not raw values.

## Typography
- Typography sizes come from `--step-*` tokens or `--fluid-body`.

## Layout
- Container widths come from theme primitives (e.g., `$frameMax` / `--frame-max`) or `.c-container` modifiers.
- Hero layout is controlled via CSS custom properties on `.page-hero`, not inline styles.
- Reuse existing classes where sensible, especially global constructs:
  - layout/composition classes (`.c-*`, `.l-*`)
  - utilities (`.u-*`)
  - molecule-level blocks (for example `.btn`)
- New classes should be introduced only when reuse cannot express the requirement cleanly.

## Theme (SCSS vs CSS Variables)
- **SCSS variables are the source of truth** for theming.
- CSS custom properties are emitted from SCSS for runtime alignment only.
- If a value is purely theme/config, prefer SCSS; if it must vary at runtime, use `var(--*)`.

## Templates
- Keep template logic in a single PHP block per section to avoid tag-juggling bugs.

## Token-Driven Components
- Use spacing and typography tokens (`--space-*`, `--step-*`, `--lh-*`) instead of raw values.
- Prefer color tokens from theme (`--color-*`, `--shadow-*`, `--radius-*`).
- For transparent colors, use RGB + alpha tokens:
  - `rgb(var(--white-rgb) / var(--alpha-85))`
  - `rgb(var(--color-brand-primary-rgb) / var(--alpha-16))`
- Avoid raw values. If a token does not exist, create a **semantic token** (e.g., `--cta-pad-y`, `--card-gap`, `--hero-cut-angle`) in the theme/token layer so intent is explicit and can map to theme primitives later.
- Use `color-mix()` when intentionally blending two colors, not as a replacement for simple opacity.

## Motion
- Observer state should be generic:
  - `.observe` = managed by observer script
  - `.visible` = currently in viewport
- Animation is opt-in and declarative in CSS:
  - `.observe.animate` = neutral/pre-entry state
  - `.observe.animate.visible` = animated/entered state
- Progressive enhancement:
  - animation-only hidden states should be gated by `.js-observers` on `<html>` so content remains visible with JS disabled.
- Reduced-motion handling belongs in CSS only (`prefers-reduced-motion`), not in observer JS.

## Normalized Legacy Decisions
- Keep SCSS partial responsibilities clear: tokens/base/compositions/utilities/blocks/exceptions.
- Do not reintroduce broad global component selectors where block roots exist.
- Avoid one-off values in components when an equivalent token exists.
- Keep exception styles narrowly scoped and easy to remove.
