# Design + Style System Gaps

Last reviewed: 2026-02-17

This file tracks what is still missing in the design-system docs, and what has already been closed.

## Resolved
1. CSS layer conventions are documented.
   - See `docs/design/layers.md`.
2. Utilities are cataloged.
   - See `docs/design/utilities.md`.
3. Compositions are documented.
   - See `docs/design/compositions.md`.
4. Block/component inventory exists.
   - See `docs/design/components.md`.
5. Token inventory exists.
   - See `docs/design/tokens.md`.
6. Exceptions policy exists.
   - See `docs/design/exceptions.md`.
7. Prototype styling guidance exists.
   - See `docs/design/prototypes.md`.
8. Accessibility checklist exists.
   - See `docs/design/accessibility.md`.

## Open
1. Token usage cookbook examples are still sparse.
   - `docs/design/style-system.md` defines policy, but practical patterns for common implementations (cards, section rails, button variants) could be expanded.

## Next Improvements
1. Add a short cookbook section in `docs/design/style-system.md` with 5-8 copyable examples.
2. Add component-level examples that reference `docs/design/accessibility.md` directly.
