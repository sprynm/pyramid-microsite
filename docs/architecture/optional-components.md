# Optional Components

This list tracks components that are intentionally optional to control CSS size.
Enable them only by uncommenting their `@use` line in `webroot/css/scss/stylesheet.scss`.

## Current Optional Components
- `youtube`
- `block-notifications`
- `block-breadcrumbs`
- `block-pagination`
- `block-gallery`
- `block-tables`
- `block-subnav`

## Notes
- Keep this list short and accurate.
- If an optional component becomes baseline, move it into the main stack and remove it here.
