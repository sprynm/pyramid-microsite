# Architecture Docs

This folder describes how the system works at a structural level.
Use it for runtime behavior, system organization, and platform-specific rules.

## Purpose
- Explain how the CMS is structured and how it runs.
- Capture system-level workflows (e.g., prototype installation/activation).
- Document folder meaning and ownership boundaries.
